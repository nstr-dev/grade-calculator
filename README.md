A clean, powerful dashboard for tracking your academic performance.
Easily calculate the grades you need to pass, visualize your progress, and stay on top of your subjects with a modern interface built for clarity and speed. The Grade Calculator supports weighted grades, customizable grading scales, and flexible subject organization - for example, if you attend mulitple schools and want to separate those subjects.

Use it [online](https://grades.nstr.dev) or self-host it with Docker.

## Screenshots

The screenshots below use following grading system:

| Best grade | Worst grade | Grade required to pass |
| ---------- | ----------- | ---------------------- |
| 100        | 0           | 60                     |

You can change these values according to your needs inside the grade calculators settings.

_Note: only numeric grading scales are supported at the moment. You can use percentages instead, if you use a letter grading scale. I will try to add this feature soon._
